## General Info
***
The goal of this app was to aid people who are struggling with their mental health. The app will consist of a mood tracker, a to-do checklist of basic self-care steps, and mood entries which include a self-care survey. I wanted to create this app because I have family members who struggle with self-care during times when their mental health isnâ€™t doing the best. I feel like a checklist to help take care of yourself would be very helpful.
